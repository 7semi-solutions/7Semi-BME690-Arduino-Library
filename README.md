The recommended way to install this library is via the **Arduino Library Manager**:

1. Open the **Arduino IDE** (v1.8.13+ or Arduino IDE 2.x)  
2. Navigate to  
   - `Sketch` > `Include Library` > `Manage Librariesâ€¦` (Arduino IDE 1.x), or  
   - `Tools` > `Manage Librariesâ€¦` or click ðŸ“š (IDE 2.x sidebar)
3. Search for:
   " 7Semi BME690 "
4. Click **Install**

Once installed, include it in your sketch:
```cpp
" #include <7semi_bme690.h> "

ðŸ”Ž Tip: You can find all 7Semi libraries by just searching for 7Semi in the Library Manager.
